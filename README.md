# FastSLAM

Hello !

This a FastSLAM Matlab code implemented on the Husky robot simulator in ROS-Gazebo.

To get the algorith mworking, run the "main.m" script. All the other files are functions used in the main script.

Hope you find it interesting !

If you have any ideas to improve the code, creatively or algorithmically, contact me ! I'd love to share ideas and learn =)
